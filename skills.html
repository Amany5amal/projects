       <h2>Skills and tools required to enter the field of bioinformatics</h2><br><br>
<h3>You must be familiar with many sciences to enter the field of bioinformatics, <br>
including: programming mainly,<li><i> basics of computer science</i></li> <br>
(it is important to learn to work on open source operating systems such as Linux),<br><br>
 <li><i>biology </i></li><br> (biology in general, molecular biology), <br><br>
 <li><i>information technology</i></li><br> (It is important to learn DBMS such as Oracle and MySQL).<br><br>

Many universities around the world offer programs to study this field at the undergraduate level,<br>
 the duration of study is four years. If you hold a university degree in medical or biological sciences,<br>
  or even in computer science, you can enroll in a two-year diploma in bioinformatics,<br>
 or you can learn this field on your own by restoring what you lack from the four sciences mentioned above.</h3><br><br><br>
       <h2> Programming languages ​​to learn in bioinformatics</h2><br>
<h3>Learning programming is a priority. If you are thinking of entering the field of bioinformatics,<br>
 you have to master a number of programming languages ​​commonly used in this field, most notably:<br><br>
     
       <li> <i>Python language:</i></li><br> 
       It is considered one of the easiest programming languages, simple,<br>
        clear and widely used in the field of bioinformatics.<br><br>
        <li><i>Perl</i></li><br>
         is widely used in building biological software.<br>
         Not as simple and straightforward as Python, but it is a useful and flexible language.<br><br>
        <li><i>R language: </i></li><br>a statistical programming language, ideal for graphing, <br>
        that contains many free biological programming tools.</h3><br><br>
