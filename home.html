        <h2>Introduction to Bioinformatics</h2><br>
        <h4>
Bioinformatics is a newly emerging scientific discipline that combines information sciences,<br>
 mathematics and biology, providing the tools to analyze genomic data and proteomics to understand <br>
 complex biological systems and find solutions.<br>
 There are two main components to bioinformatics:<br>
  the first is the development of algorithms and software tools, and the second is the analysis<br>
  and interpretation of bioinformatics using a variety of these algorithms and software tools.<br></h4>
 <h2> Bioinformatics applications and their importance</h2><br>
 <h4>
In the medical field, for example, bioinformatics contributes to Drug Design and Discovery,<br>
 as it plays a role in predicting the protein structure of cellular receptors, <br>
which is an important stage in the journey of discovering a new drug.<br>

It also contributes to Gene Therapy, which is one of the most important modern medical <br>
fields that provide hope for the treatment of many chronic diseases that are not treatable by traditional methods.<br>


Bioinformatics has many applications in personalized medicine, <br>
which is a model of treatment practice tailored to each patient based on the nature of their disease <br>
and the expected response.

It is worth noting the great role of bioinformatics in the completion of the Human Genome Project,<br>
 which determined the entire genetic sequence of humans.

In the agricultural and environmental field, bioinformatics contributes to developing agricultural crops,<br>
 improving food quality, overcoming the problem of developing insect resistance to insecticides, and many<br>
  other useful applications.<br><br><br><br><br>
